## Lesson 2: Assignment

Your second assignment will test your understanding of basic javascript. You will be
adding javascript to the html/css project you created for lesson one. Your javascript
code will be stored in a separate file called script.js. The html source code provided
contains comments with project instructions for the following...

Creating a trivia function

Handling display and logic of trivia function

Creating a small table that contains precoded movie titles and years. You will then
create inputs that prompt the user for new movie titles and years, as well as a button
that will add this information to the table.

You will also create a button that will toggle between showing a photo and a video clip
of your celebrity on youtube.

### Tips:

Remember your sanity check! It is always important to make sure that your files are
communicating. Make sure that your script and html files are communicating by creating
a simple function with an alert.

oh yeah and...

GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND!!!

## Set Up Instructions (Just in case)

1.  In your terminal command, type `npm install live-server -g`

    This will install a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server.

2.  Next you must clone a git repository that contains week one assignment instructions
    and a basic html shell for your first html/css project. There are three branches in
    the repo you will clone. The `alpha` branch will contain your assignment, with instructions
    in place of code. The `beta` will contain the completed code and serve as your answer key.
    While completing the alpha branch, simply refer to `beta` for help.

3.  Remember your Terminal Commands!

    Move to the directory you would like to clone your repo using cd (change directory)

    Clone your repo with what ever name you like typing git clone followed by the link and
    then the new name of your repo

    `git clone https://github.com/t1cgAcademy/Web-Dev-101-Week-1-Assignment.git whateverNameYouWantHere`

    Or you can simply clone the repo and get the default name

    `git clone https://github.com/t1cgAcademy/Web-Dev-101-Week-1-Assignment.git`

    Open your cloned code in Atom or Visual Studio Code

        `atom .` or `code .`

    If the above opening command does not work, you can manually open using your graphical user interface

4)  Sanity Check!!! It is always important to make sure that your code will run as
    intended by entering something simple. Here, we want to make sure that the http server (live-server)
    we downloaded from NPM will run our simple HTML shell. In your index.html file, inside
    the body tag, enter the following line...

- `<div>Hello World</div>`

5. Press `command s` on your keyboard to save the changes.

6. Now, go to your terminal command, make sure you are in your cloned git directory.

7. Now run your simple http server by typing `live-server`. Note: you must be in the projects directory.

   - When you run this command, you will see the following line... `Starting up http-server, serving ./ on: http://0.0.0.0:[someport]` This line shows the local port where your code will run.

8. Go to your browser and enter the following address with the appropriate port... `http://localhost:[someport]/`

Now you should be able to see your "Hello World" in the upper left hand corner of your browser.

Congratulations! You have just run your first HTML code. Now, get into `alpha`, follow the instructional
comments and get coding.

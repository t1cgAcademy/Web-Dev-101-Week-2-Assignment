## Lesson 2: Assignment

Your second assignment will test your understanding of basic javascript.  You will be
adding javascript to the html/css project you created for lesson one.  Your javascript
code will be stored in a separate file called script.js.  The html source code provided
contains comments with project instructions for the following...

Creating a trivia function

Creating a small table that contains precoded movie titles and years.  You will then
create inputs that prompt the user for new movie titles and years, as well as a button
that will add this information to the table.

You will also create a button that will toggle between showing a photo and a video clip
of your celebrity on youtube.  

### Tips:
Remember your sanity check!  It is always important to make sure that your files are
communicating.  Make sure that your script and html files are communicating by creating
a simple function with an alert.

oh yeah and...
